# Python rewrite notes

## Core functions preserved

- Parse markdown plans with `### Task N:` / `### Iteration N:` sections and actionable checkboxes.
- Create gigalphex-compatible plans from a free-form request.
- Commit newly created plan files by default when running inside a git
  repository.
- Commit completed plan moves after a successful full run.
- Install `.gitignore` entries for `.DS_Store` and `.gigalphex/progress/`
  during project initialization.
- Optionally initialize a missing git repository with `--init-git` and commit
  the initial working tree before execution.
- Run one task section per agent iteration.
- Stream agent output to terminal and a progress log.
- Detect gigalphex completion signals.
- Run a review loop after tasks.
- Run five specialist review agents in parallel, then synthesize/fix findings.
- Run a finalize prompt by default, with `--no-finalize` to disable it.
- Configure the agent command as `gigacode` plus arbitrary CLI args.
- Select GigaCode models per phase with `plan_model`, `task_model`,
  `review_model`, and `finalize_model`, mapped to GigaCode's `--model` flag.
  Read-only reviewers use `review_model`; review synthesis and fixes use
  `task_model`.
- Initialize the local `.gigalphex/` config automatically on first real plan
  creation or execution.
- Initialize editable global prompt templates automatically and create local
  project prompt overrides only with `--init-prompts`.
- Bound executor runs with session timeout, idle timeout, retry count, retry
  delay, and review worker limit.
- Classify transient and rate-limit executor failures with configurable
  patterns, including optional longer waits before rate-limit retries.
- Validate git repository state, detect default branch, create/switch plan branch, and move completed plans.
- Run full and tasks-only plan execution in an isolated git worktree with
  `--worktree`.

## Intentionally deferred

- Web dashboard.
- Notifications.
- External second-model review.
- Docker wrapper.

The Python version is intentionally small first. It launches `gigacode` in
one-shot mode with
`-p {prompt} --approval-mode=auto-edit --allowed-tools=run_shell_command` by
default. GigaCode 26.5.17 needs `--allowed-tools=run_shell_command` for tests
and git commands; `--approval-mode=auto-edit` only covers edit/write tools.
Although GigaCode marks `-p/--prompt` as deprecated, its positional `query..`
form is ambiguous when combined with array-valued options. The runtime itself
recommends `-p` on non-interactive approval failures. If custom args omit
`{prompt}`, the executor adds `-p <generated prompt>`.
If the CLI later needs a subcommand or different flags, the executor boundary
is `GigaCodeExecutor`, so adapting the invocation should be one local change.

GigaCode model selection is a CLI concern, not a prompt concern. The CLI exposes
`-m/--model`, so gigalphex adds `--model <name>` to the phase invocation instead
of embedding model names in the prompt text.

## Observed GigaCode behavior

- Prompts are plain text instructions. The task prompt tells GigaCode to read a
  markdown plan, find the first unchecked `### Task N:` or `### Iteration N:`
  section, complete it, test it, commit it, mark checkboxes as `[x]`, and emit a
  completion signal.
- One task section is expected per GigaCode launch. The prompt explicitly says:
  `Do not continue to the next task section.`
- Workspace guard is enforced by GigaCode. Files outside its workspace cannot be
  edited unless the GigaCode invocation includes the needed
  `--include-directories` values.
- Approval mode must be explicit in non-interactive runs. Real logs show
  `Warning: Tool "run_shell_command" requires user approval but cannot execute
  in non-interactive mode`; GigaCode help shows that shell execution additionally
  requires `--allowed-tools=run_shell_command`.
- GigaCode appears to run on Node.js; `MaxListenersExceededWarning` can surface
  in its output.
- GigaCode has administrative CLI subcommands (`mcp`, `extensions`, `auth`,
  `sandbox`, and `hooks`) but no task-execution subcommand. There is also no
  observed JSON/REST API, official Python SDK, or `IN_PROGRESS` signal.
  `gigalphex` therefore uses the default `gigacode [query..]` command and
  treats the CLI process and output stream as the integration boundary.

## Usage

Run without installing:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m gigalphex.cli docs/plans/my-feature.md
```

Inspect prompts without invoking GigaCode:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m gigalphex.cli --dry-run docs/plans/my-feature.md
```

Configure command shape:

```ini
[gigalphex]
gigacode_command = gigacode
gigacode_args = -p {prompt} --approval-mode=auto-edit --allowed-tools=run_shell_command
gigacode_interactive_args = --prompt-interactive {prompt} --approval-mode=auto-edit
gigacode_skills_dir = ~/.gigacode/skills
default_branch =
```

Create local config:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m gigalphex.cli --init
```

Global prompt templates are created automatically under
`~/.config/gigalphex/prompts/`. Create local project overrides only when needed:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m gigalphex.cli --init-prompts
```

Create a new plan:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m gigalphex.cli --install-planning-skill
PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m gigalphex.cli --plan "add user authentication"
```

With a terminal attached, plan creation invokes the installed GigaCode
`planning` skill interactively. Use `--quick`, or run without a TTY, to use the
one-shot `make_plan.txt` prompt.
